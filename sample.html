# Can you add a little script to turn Markdown into an interactive HTML?

  * Yes you can!
  * No you cannot!
  * WTF?

## You are right

Whatever you've answered, it was a great journey of your imagination to think, to fathom, to contemplate the unimaginable.
Markdown and HTML -- those are truly two pioneers of brainy exercises in our age. I challenge you to give them a go once more here.

## But how can I do it?

Through trust and positive thinking, of course. People strive to make decisions on their own,
with as little help from the outside as possible. Don't follow that passage though. Do not attempt to drive
the vehicle of your imagination down the path of the desperation.

## Who wants to be millionaire?

Bitcoins, yen, financial renaissance and the boom and bust of the Mars and Venus. Those are the symbols of the 20th century.
Today we need more. We need billionaires to merely stand in place. We need trillionaires to make a humble step forward.
For a little man, for a humble man, for the humanity.
